# 10WeeksofDevops-Day1

As part of 10 weeks of Devops challenge, i started with my Day 1 challenge

In this challenge, I am going to deploy a static web app in Azure via GitHub actions.

For that i have created this repository and taken 2 files - index.html and style.css, which i have uploaded into the root of this repository.

Step 1:
Create a static web app with **source as Github**, as shown in below pic

Note: CLick sign with Github and integrate to your github account. Then select your organisation and repository.

Step 2:
Click Review+Create and create a static webapp
